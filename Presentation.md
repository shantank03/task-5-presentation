# When Beer Caused People to Settle Down (5000 B.C.)
* Historians have found that early humans made beer from grain and water before bread
* Beer is formed when cereals with certain sugars undergo fermentation; wild yeast spores in the air lead to the accidental creation of the world's first beers by our early ancestors.
* Evidence from pottery analysis reveals beer production as early as 7,000 years ago
* Interestingly early Mesopotamian brewers were mainly women

# Beer moves to Europe (500 B.C.)
* Like any objects of trade beer moved into Europe through the ancient Greeks
* Beer was often used to pay workers instead of actual wages or given as daily rations
* It was drank in Ancient Rome but it was phased out by wine

# The Middle Ages
* Beer was very popular in all social class around Northern and Eastern Europe where it was hard to grow grapes
* Brewers guilds and other large-scale brewing begain to pop up but a lot of brewing was done by homebrewers
* Beer in this time was made through an herbal mixture called gruit but it had very little preservation properties
* Charlemagne, the great emperor of the Holy Empire, claimed beer to be an important part of living

# Early Modern Europe
* Beer making on a wider scale took off in the 14th and 15th centuries with monastaries and pubs brewing for mass consumption
* Hops were starting to get added to beer and the technique was perfected by Bohemian villagers in the 13th century
* In 1516 William IV, Duke of Bavaria, enacted the Reinheitsgebot (purity law), one of the oldest food purity laws

# Arrival to the Americas
* The first beer brewed in the New World occured at Sir Walter Raleigh's colony in Virginia in 1587 
* Thanksgiving might be nice and all but the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock because their beer supplies were low
* The first commerical brewery opened in 1612 in New Amesterdam (now known as New York City)

# A Bunch of Drunk Guys stoke the fire of Revolution
* Revoluationary groups, like the Sons of Liberty, met in pubs and often discussed the key issues of the day over a tankard of beer
* I mean how else would a bunch of libertarians convince a rag-tag bunch of colonists to fight the world's best army?

# Industrialization Changes EVERYTHING!
* New advances in technology lead to the creation of the thermometer and hydrometer
* Changes in the types of malts used in the kilning process lead to changes in beer tastes
* Louise Pastour's discovery of yeast's role in fermentation lead to brewers changing their methods to prevent beer souring

# Impact of Immigrants
* In the early days of America most people drank ales, the common beer in England
* The arrival of German immigrants caused a gradual shift from ales to lagers (Anheuser-Busch, Miller, Coors, Pabst, etc.)
* Technilogical advances like commerical refrigeration, automatic bottling, pasteurization, and railroad distribution lead to an increase in nationwide beer consumption
* By the end of the 19th century there were close to 2,500 breweries in the U.S.

# Prohibition
* Following it's passage in 1919, the Eighteenth Amendment banning the sale of alcoholic beverages went into affect in January 1920
* Bootlegging became the big thing and many well-established breweries were subsequently forced to fold
* Only 160 breweries survived Prohibition

# The Homebrewing Revolution
* Up till the 1970s only the major brewing companies continue production
* Homebrewing clubs in California increase the popularity of microbrewing
* New Albion is the first in the rebirth of brewpubs and microbreweries in the US opening in California in 1976

# Beer-onomics
* The U.S. produces more than 20% of the world's beer
* Industry revnues topped out at $107.6 billion in 2016
* The craft beer market rose 10% to $23.5 billion
* There are over 3,400 breweries in the U.S. today (more than pre-Prohibition levels)

# Market Monopolies
* Desipte consistent annual growth, Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors comprise about 75% of the industry's total market share
* High barriers to entry like competition, capital intensity, and excessive regulations prevent smaller microbrewers from entering the market
* Conflicts about product distribution have prolonged tensions between smaller brewers and large-scale producers
* Simple game theory suggests that the two firms work together to collude and control beer prices, but the law says otherwise
