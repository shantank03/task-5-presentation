# When Beer Caused People to Settle Down (5000 B.C.)
* Historians have found that early humans made beer from grain and water before bread
* Beer is formed when cereals with certain sugars undergo fermentation; wild yeast spores in the air lead to the accidental creation of the world's first beers by our early ancestors.
* Evidence from pottery analysis reveals beer production as early as 7,000 years ago
* Interestingly early brewers in Mesopotamia were mainly women

# Beer moves to Europe (500 B.C.)
* Like any objects of trade beer moved into Europe through the ancient Greeks
* Beer was often used to pay workers instead of actual wages or given as daily rations
* It was drank in Ancient Rome but it was soon phased out by wine

# The Middle Ages
* Beer was very popular in all social class around Northern and Eastern Europe where it was hard to grow grapes
* Brewers guilds begain to pop up but a lot of brewing was done by homebrewers
* Beer in this time was made through a mixture of herbs called gruit but it had very little preservation properties

# Early Modern Europe
* Beer making on a wide-scale took off in the 14th and 15th centuries with monastaries and pubs brewing for mass consumption
* Hops were starting to get added to beer and the technique was perfected by Bohemian villagers in the 13th century
* In 1516 William IV, Duke of Bavaria, enacted the Reinheitsgebot (purity law), one of the oldest food purity laws

# Arrival to the Americas
* The first beer brewed in the New World occured at Sir Walter Raleigh's colony in Virginia in 1587 
* Thanksgiving might be nice and all but the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock because their beer supplies were low
* The first commerical brewery opened in 1612 in New Amesterdam (now known as New York City)

# A Bunch of Drunk Guys stoke the fire of Revolution
* Revoluationary groups, like the Sons of Liberty, met in pubs and often discussed the key issues of the day over a tankard of beer
* I mean how else would a bunch of libertarians convince a rag-tag bunch of colonists to fight the world's best army?

# Impact of Immigrants
* In the early days of America most people drank ales, the common beer in England
* The arrival of German immigrants caused a gradual shift from ales to lagers

# Prohibition

# The Homebrewing Revolution

# Beer-onomics

* The craft beer market rose 10% to $23.5 billion

## Market Monopolies
* Desipte consistent annual growth, Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors comprise about 75% of the industry's total market share
